# Safe-Parking-LA-Housing-Application

Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) and Safe Parking LA (SPLA) are
two organizations in Los Angeles that service the homeless community. LAHSA
provides beds in shelters and SPLA manages spaces in parking lots for people living
in their cars. In the city’s new app for homelessness, people in need of housing can
apply for a space with either service. For this homework, you will help SPLA choose
applicants that meet the SPLA specific requirements for the space and that also
optimize the use of the parking lot for that week.
Applicant information entered into the homelessness app:
Applicant ID: 5 digits
Gender: M/F/O
Age: 0-100
Pets: Y/N
Medical conditions: Y/N
Car: Y/N
Driver’s License: Y/N
Days of the week needed: 0/1 for each day of the 7 days of the week (Monday-
Sunday)

Example applicant record: 00001F020NNYY1001000 for applicant id 00001, female,
20 years old, no pets, no medical conditions, with car and driver’s license, who
needs housing for Monday and Thursday.
SPLA requirements differ from LAHSA. They are both picking from the same applicant
list. They each have different resources and may not be qualified to accept the same
applicants. SPLA and LAHSA alternate choosing applicants one by one. They must
choose an applicant if there is still a qualified one on the list (no passing). SPLA
applicants must have a car and driver’s license, but no medical conditions. LAHSA
shelter can only serve women over 17 years old without pets. Both SPLA and LAHSA
have limited resources that must be used efficiently. Efficiency is calculated by how
many of the spaces are used during the week. For example, a SPLA parking lot has 10
spaces and can have at most 10*7 days = 70 different applicants for the week. SPLA
tries to maximize its efficiency rate.
